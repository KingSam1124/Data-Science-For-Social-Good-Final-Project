This element of selection involved in both ascribing and analyzing historical significance is one factor in making the discipline of history distinct from the past.[1] Historians consider knowledge of dates and events within and between specific historical periods the primary content of history, also known as \"first-order knowledge\" or substantive concepts. In contrast, historical significance is an example of a subject specific secondary key concept or \"second-order knowledge\" also known as a meta-concept,[2] or disciplinary concept,[3] which is typically used to help organize knowledge within a subject area, frame suitable areas of inquiry, provide the framework upon which substantive knowledge can be built, and map learner progression within a subject discipline.[4] Specifically with regards to historical significance, the way dates and events are chosen and ascribed relative significance is not fixed and can change over time according to which criteria were used to form the judgement of significance as well as how those criteria were chosen themselves in the first place.

The service was attended by President of the United States Ronald Reagan, who had been invited by the West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Bitburg ceremony was widely interpreted in Germany as the beginning of the \"normalization\" of the nation's Nazi past, and inspired a slew of criticisms and defenses that made up the initiating arguments of the Historikerstreit. The dispute quickly outgrew the initial context of the Bitburg controversy, however, and became a series of broader historiographic, political, and critical debates about how the episode of the Holocaust should be understood in Germany's history and identity."}

It limited holding company operations to a single state, thus subjecting them to effective state regulation. It also broke up any holding companies with more than two tiers, forcing divestitures so that each became a single integrated system serving a limited geographic area. Another purpose of the PUHCA was to keep utility holding companies engaged in regulated businesses from also engaging in unregulated businesses. The act was based on the conclusions and recommendations of the 1928-35 Federal Trade Commission investigation of the electric industry. On March 12, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt released a report he commissioned by  the National Power Policy Committee.  This report became the template for the PUHCA.

Scholars rely upon extant sources, such as those of contemporaries like Aristophanes or disciples of Socrates like Plato and Xenophon, for knowing anything about Socrates. However, these sources contain contradictory details of his life, words, and beliefs when taken together. This complicates the attempts at reconstructing the beliefs and philosophical views held by the historical Socrates. It has become apparent to scholarship that this problem is seemingly impossible to clarify and thus perhaps now classified as unsolvable.[2][3] Early proposed solutions to the matter still pose significant problems today.[4]"}

{"Topic":"Technology","Page_Title":"Gerontechnology","First_Paragraph":"Gerontechnology, also called gerotechnology is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic as well as a professional field that combines various disciplines of gerontology and technology. Sustainability of an aging society depends on our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including assistive technology and inclusive design, for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort as well as safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to health, housing, mobility, communication, leisure, work and also the personality\/individual dispositions of older people. Gerontechnology is most frequently identified as a subset of HealthTech and is -- since the 2010s -- more commonly referred to as AgeTech or Agetech in Europe and the United States. Research outcomes form the basis for designers, builders, engineers, manufacturers, and those in the health professions (nursing, medicine, gerontology, geriatrics, environmental psychology, developmental psychology, etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of ages."}

{"Topic":"Technology","Page_Title":"Hot stab","First_Paragraph":"A hot stab is a type of subsea connector specifically designed to be easily inserted and removed by a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) manipulator arm. The hot stab is the connector which supplies remote utilities. It is normally inserted into a port after removing the plug stab, which is left in the port when the hot stab is disconnected, to keep the port clean and free of fouling when not in use. The alignment is generally not critical for insertion, and the stab is guided into the port by the port geometry, which tends to be concentric cylinder and cone sections, tapering down from the handle end to the tip, with a series of O-ring seals separating the ports or contacts spaced along the length. The stab may be locked into place or may require the ROV to hold it in place while it is in use.[1][2][3][4]"}

{"Topic":"Technology","Page_Title":"Product ecosystem theory","First_Paragraph":"Product ecosystem theory is an emerging theory that describes how the design of manufactured products evolves over time and draws parallels with how species evolve within a natural ecosystem. Fundamental to this theory is that manufactured product lines respond to external threats and opportunities in much the same way that species respond to threats and opportunities. Competition and other environmental pressures may cause a species to become extinct. An example of the parallel in consumer products is the way in which the typewriter became displaced (or extinct) due to pressures from the personal computer. \nProducts lines can be seen to incrementally change and branch over time following the principle of phyletic gradualism. Or they can be seen to have periods of stasis followed by disruptive innovation. This follows the principle of punctuated equilibrium."}
{"Topic":"Technology","Page_Title":"Representational harm","First_Paragraph":"Systems cause representational harm when they misrepresent a group of people in a negative manner. Representational harms include perpetuating harmful stereotypes about or minimizing the existence of a social group, such as a racial, ethnic, gender, or religious group.[1] Machine learning algorithms often commit representational harm when they learn patterns from data that have algorithmic bias, and this has been shown to be the case with large language models.[2] While preventing representational harm in models is essential to prevent harmful biases, researchers often lack precise definitions of representational harm and conflate it with allocative harm, an unequal distribution of resources among social groups, which is more widely studied and easier to measure.[1] However, recognition of representational harms is growing and preventing them has become an active research area. Researchers have recently developed methods to effectively quantify representational harm in algorithms, making progress on preventing this harm in the future.[3][4]"}

{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Oral democracy","First_Paragraph":"Oral democracy is a talk-based form of government and political system in which citizens of a determined community have the opportunity to deliberate, through direct oral engagement and mass participation, in the civic and political matters of their community.[1] Additionally, oral democracy represents a form of direct democracy, which has the purpose of empowering citizens by creating open spaces that promote an organized process of discussion, debate, and dialogue that aims to reach consensus and to impact policy decision-making.[2] Political institutions based on this idea of direct democracy seek to decrease the possibilities of state capture from elites by holding them accountable, to encourage civic participation and collective action, and to improve the efficiency and adaptability of development interventions and public policy implementation.[2]"}

{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Partisan sorting","First_Paragraph":"Partisan sorting is an effect in politics in which voters sort themselves into parties that match their ideology.[1] Partisan sorting is distinct from political polarization, which is where partisans subscribe to increasingly extreme positions.  As political scientist Nolan McCarty explains, \"party sorting can account for the increased differences across partisans even if the distribution of...attitudes in the population remains unchanged or moves uniformly in one direction or the other.\" As an example given by McCarty, the gap between the Democratic Party and Republican Party on views towards immigrants strengthening the country with hard work and talents has widened from a 2-point gap in 1994 to a 42-point gap in 2017. A reasonable explanation is that of partisan sorting: those who are pro-immigrant shifted into the Democratic party and immigration-restrictions have shifted towards the Republican party. According to McCarty, this explains the widening gap between the two parties, considering how pro-immigration viewpoints between the two surveys have increased by 35% since 1994.[2]"}
{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Phantom border","First_Paragraph":"A phantom border (German: Phantomgrenze) is an informal delineation following the approximate course of an abolished political border, associated with demographic differences on each side as a continuing legacy of historical division, despite official geopolitical union.[1] Not all former political borders are today phantom borders. Factors that may increase the likelihood of a political border becoming a phantom border upon dissolution, include: short time elapsed since the border's dissolution, long existence of the former border, imporousity of the former border, and divergent characteristics of the political entity formerly governing one side of the border."}
{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Political philosophy","First_Paragraph":"Political philosophy, or political theory, is the philosophical study of government, addressing questions about the nature, scope, and legitimacy of public agents and institutions and the relationships between them. Its topics include politics, justice, liberty, property, rights, law, and authority: what they are, if they are needed, what makes a government legitimate, what rights and freedoms it should protect, what form it should take, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever."}
{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Political capitalism","First_Paragraph":"Political capitalism[1] or Politically oriented capitalism is a term coined by Max Weber in his 1921 book Economy and Society to describe monetary profit-making through non-market means.[2][3] In 2018, Holcombe describes political capitalism is an economic system in which the sharp distinction between states and markets is blurred.[4][5][6][7][8]"}
{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Political polarization","First_Paragraph":"Political polarization (spelled polarisation in British English, Australian English, and New Zealand English) is the divergence of political attitudes away from the center, towards ideological extremes.[1][2][3] Scholars distinguish between ideological polarization (differences between the policy positions) and affective polarization (an emotional dislike and distrust of political out-groups).[4]"}

{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Politically exposed person","First_Paragraph":"In financial regulation, a politically exposed person (PEP) is one who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence they may hold. The terms \"politically exposed person\" and senior foreign political figure are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums."}
{"Topic":"Politics","Page_Title":"Politicisation","First_Paragraph":"Politicisation (also politicization; see English spelling differences) is a concept in political science and theory used to explain how ideas, entities or collections of facts are given a political tone or character, and are consequently assigned to the ideas and strategies of a particular group or party, thus becoming the subject of contestation. Politicisation has been described as compromising objectivity,[1] and is linked with political polarisation.[2][3] Conversely, it can have a democratising effect and enhance political choice,[4] and has been shown to improve the responsiveness of supranational institutions such as the European Union.[5] The politicisation of a group is more likely to occur when justifications for political violence are considered acceptable within a society, or in the absence of norms condemning violence.[6]"}
